## üõ†Ô∏è Project Setup

### 1. ESP8266 Firmware
- Install ESP8266 board in Arduino IDE
- Connect to Wi-Fi and Firebase using Arduino code
- Listen for ON/OFF commands from Firebase and control relay

### 2. Django Backend
- Expose APIs: `/appliance/on`, `/appliance/off`, `/status`
- Authenticate requests and push commands to Firebase
- Use Django REST Framework for simplicity

### 3. Android App (Jetpack Compose)
- Login or register user
- UI buttons for each appliance (toggle state)
- API calls to Django endpoints
- Display real-time status using Firebase listeners

## üß© How It Works
1. User opens the Android app and taps the appliance toggle.
2. App sends a POST request to Django API with the command.
3. Django pushes command to Firebase Realtime Database.
4. ESP8266 listens for changes in Firebase node, reads the command.
5. ESP8266 triggers relay module to control the appliance.
6. ESP8266 updates the device state back to Firebase.
7. App updates UI based on Firebase real-time changes.

## üìä Use Case Diagram

**Actors:**
- User (Phone App)
- ESP8266 (Controller)
- Django Server (API)
- Firebase (State DB)

**Use Cases:**
- User logs in and sends command
- Server processes and stores the command
- ESP8266 reads from Firebase and toggles relay
- Device state updated and reflected back in app

## üë• Team Roles & Responsibilities

### 1. Pradeep Soni ‚Äì Backend & Android Developer
- Designed and implemented Android application with Jetpack Compose.
- Developed Django backend with RESTful API for command handling.
- Integrated Firebase Admin SDK with Django server.

### 2. Divyansh Sharma ‚Äì UI/UX & Embedded Developer
- Programmed ESP8266 to fetch and execute Firebase commands.
- Managed app-to-server communication and error handling.
- Built real-time UI using Firebase SDK.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion
This **Smart Home Automation System** is a low-cost, scalable, and intuitive solution built with modern technology stacks. It bridges IoT hardware and real-time software interfaces, enabling users to securely control home appliances from anywhere. It showcases effective integration of microcontrollers, web APIs, mobile development, and cloud databases.
